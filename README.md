# Image Steganography

## Overview

This repository implements a simple yet powerful image steganography technique for secure communication between Alice and Bob. The project allows Alice to encrypt and embed data into images, which can then be transmitted to Bob for decryption and extraction.

## Features

- **Secure Communication:** Protect your data with encryption before embedding it into images, ensuring confidentiality during transmission.

- **Steganography:** Conceal encrypted data within image files, providing a covert channel for communication.

- **Alice and Bob Modules:** Separate modules for Alice and Bob functionalities to simulate sender and receiver roles.

## Usage

### Alice (Sender)

### Bob (Reciever)

## Run
- First **python alice.py**
- Then **python bob.py**
- You will see two different terminal. Be sure that file paths are correct.
